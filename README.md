# FlyingForts
 The official repository for the mod "Flying Forts" for Forts on the Steam workshop.
 
 I will not be accepting new weapons because Flying Forts isn't supposed to be a weapon pack. Please fork this repo if you wish to do that.
 
You are allowed to upload your own version of Flying Forts to the Forts steam workshop, or copy anything in this mod for use in the Forts Steam workshop
Usage of assets outside of the Forts Steam workshop is prohibited.

 To get sound working in the mod, download FMOD studio version 2.1.6 and import the project folder "FlyingForts2.1.6".
 Delete the master bank, create a new master bank, and re-assign the sound events to that bank.
 Then "Build" the bank (F7), and copy the .bank files into FlyingFortsMod/audio/

 Alternatively, if you don't want to use FMOD studio, the sound files are in FlyingForts2.1.6/Assets/
 
Changing the "sb" prefixes in the mod will also be appreciated for maxium compatibility.
