# FlyingForts
 The official repository for the mod "Flying Forts" for Forts on the Steam workshop.
 
 I will not be accepting new weapons. Please fork this repo if you wish to.
 
 To upload your own version of Flying Forts to the steam workshop, you must credit the original mod with the link to the workshop page.
 For example:
 
 Original mod "Flying Forts": https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1835113084
 
 To get sound working in the mod, download FMOD studio version 2.1.6 and import the project folder "FlyingForts2.1.6".
 Delete the master bank, create a new master bank, and re-assign the sound events to that bank.
 Then "Build" the bank (F7), and copy the .bank files into FlyingFortsMod/audio
 
Changing the "sb" prefixes in the mod will also be appreciated for maxium compatibility.
